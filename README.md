Currently we have a different branch for different learning algorithms. In the near future, we will be mergining them as we continue to work on the project.

# temporal_regularization_control



We are extending the research work done on "Temporal Regularization for Markov Decision Process" https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00429 published in NeurIPS 2018 to control case. <br/>

This repository contains our implementation for temporal regularization in control setting.
